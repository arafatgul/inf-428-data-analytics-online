# Assignment 1

Assignment 1 is worth 14 marks.  The main purpose of the assignment is to have you   

1. Install KNIME
2. Access KNIME examples, download and transfer examples to your local workspace.
3. Install Annaconda.
4. Join Github, Install GitHub Desktop. Get the ipython notebook examples from github and run them on your local machine. (See the Python/Annaconda/Github note for details on how to join Github and find the class repo)[Module1/Python]. 
5. Run 'opencsv' examples in KNIME and IPython. 
6. Find a new CSV file online.
7. Create a simple workflow that opens the new csv file in KNIME. 
8. Create a simple IPython notebook that opens the new csv file.

## Submit

A word file containing the following. 

1.  The name of your github account. AND A SCREENSHOT OF GITHUB DESKTOP showing that you have cloned the class repository uploaded.
2.  The name of the .csv file you found online, a link to where you found it, any instructions needed to download it, and a description of what the file contains and why it is interesting to you.  
3.  A screen shot of the KNIME workflow in part 7, showing the open data.  (Hint you need to show the 'file reader'->'file table').  THE KNIME SCREENSHOT SHOULD ALSO SHOW "knime-server" workgroup visible in the left top corner. 
4.  A screen shot of the IPython (aka Jupyter) notebook from part 8.  Note while it's possible to simply 'open' the data in Jupyter, what I'd like to see is a couple of lines of code used to open the data (as done in the class examples)

## Example Submission

As an example here is what I would submit if doing the assignment.

1.  My github name is bnorthan below is a screenshot I took of github desktop

2.  I found my data here [on baseball reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/2016.shtml).  To get the data you need to scroll down to the 'Team Standard Batting' table, click on 'share and more' and then 'get table as .csv'. 
3.  Below is a screen shot of my data open in KNIME (note you can barely see KNIME server in the top left panel (KNIME Explorer))
