# MACHINE LEARNING STEPS

* Collect Data  
  * Scrape a web site  
  * Use an API  
  * create a survey  
  * built a device (weather, blood glucose)  
* Prepare Input data  
  * Fix errors  
  * Deal with missing data  
* Analyze data
  * Do you recognize patterns
* Train algorithm  
  * This is machine learning  
  * Apply algorithm to known values so it can learn
* Test algorithm
  * Apply algorithm to known values to test performance Test algorithm
  * DO NOT use training data for testing. 
* Tune algorithm
  * Adjust algorithm parameters to achieve better test performance
* Validate algorithm 
  * Apply algorithm to completely new test values to verify algorithm works on 'unseen' data.  That is test data that has not been tuned.
