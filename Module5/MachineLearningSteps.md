# MACHINE LEARNING STEPS

* Collect Data  
  * Scrape a web site  
  * Use an API  
  * create a survey  
  * built a device (weather, blood glucose)  
* Prepare Input data  
  * Fix errors  
  * Deal with missing data  
* Analyze data
  * Do you recognize patterns
* Train algorithm  
  * This is machine learning  
  * Apply algorithm to known values so it can learn
* Test algorithm
  * Apply algorithm to known values to test performance
