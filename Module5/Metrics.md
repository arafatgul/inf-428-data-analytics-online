# Machine Learning Evaluation Metrics 

## Accuracy  
  Accuracy is simply (number right)/(number wrong)  

## Sensitivity and Specificity  
* Sensitivity  
  * If a person has diabetes how often will it be detected? (True positives)  
* Specificity  
  * If a person does not have diabetes how often will they test negative? (True negatives)  
* What is the easiest way to get 100% Sensitivity  
* What is the easiest way to get 100% Specificity  

## Precision and Recall  

[see wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)  

### Precision  

"fraction of relevant instances among retrieved instances"

System identifies 100 cases of diabetes, 80 are truly diabetes, Precision = 80/100 = 0.8.  

### Recall  

"total amount of relevant instances that were actually retrieved"

120 cases of diabetes, system identifies 80, recall is 80/120 = .67.

Recall is the same as sensitivity.
